      <h3>Monolith: The Big Giant</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>monolith</strong>. A single application, tightly packed, all features bundled together. One codebase. One deploy. Easy to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
        But once it grows? It turns into a bug infested machine where fixing something in the payment system could accidentally break the login. Slow builds, large deploys and huge effort
      </p>
    </section>

      <h3>Enter Microservices</h3>
      <p>
        Microservices are like breaking a LEGO castle into small pieces. Each service is independent, has a clear function and focuses on a single responsibility
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of one app, we now have many tiny apps — maybe a <code>user-service</code>, a <code>payment-service</code>, and a <code>notification-service</code>. They talk to each other over APIs (like REST or gRPC)
      </p>
      <p>
        If something goes wrong in one service, the rest of the system doesn’t necessarily collapse. So it's easy to debug and iterate
      </p>
    </section>

      <h3>Why I’m Doing Microservices</h3>
      <p>
        I'm currently working on a web backend powered by Kubernetes. I wanted to learn how to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build scalable backend architectures</li>
        <li>Use Docker and Kubernetes in real projects</li>
        <li>Deploy services independently and test them in isolation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Microservices enables devs to have a playground to explore real-world backend problems while building something I can deploy and scale.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Challenges & Tradeoffs</h3>
      <p>
        But there are also cons to the pros. Microservices mean:
        <ul>
          <li>More moving parts</li>
          <li>Harder debugging (logs are everywhere!)</li>
          <li>DevOps complexity (CI/CD, monitoring, network issues)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        But for large-scale systems or teams, the benefits start to outweigh the costs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Microservices is not some fancy tech. It's thoughtful approach to scaling teams and software but at a cost of compexity
      </p>
      <p>
        For my current learning journey, it makes perfect sense. They force me to think about real-world problems: APIs, failover, deployment, and system design.
